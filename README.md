# HoneyPot-in-Azure-Cloud üçØ 

## Objective

Deploying honeypots in the Azure cloud environment to detect and analyze malicious activities.


### Skills Learned
- Azure Cloud Services 
- T-Pot Deployment
- Honeypot Configuration 
- SpiderFoot Integration 
- Kibana Data Analysis

### Tools Used
- Utilized T-Pot, an open-source honeypot framework, deployed within an Azure Virtual Machine, to monitor and analyze incoming traffic and potential threats.
Configured T-Pot to emulate multiple services and protocols, including HTTP, FTP, SSH, and Telnet, to attract and capture diverse attack vectors and malicious activities.
Using SpiderFoot, uncover hidden insights, track potential threats, and gather valuable intelligence from across the web. With its powerful OSINT capabilities, SpiderFoot empowers cybersecurity professionals to enhance threat detection, conduct comprehensive reconnaissance, and stay one step ahead of evolving security risks.



The T-Pot attack map is a visual representation of the live attacks and malicious activities detected by T-Pot honeypots deployed in various locations. It provides real-time insight into the global threat landscape by displaying geolocated data about attackers, their origin, target IP addresses, attack types, and frequency.
